# PCA and K-Means Clustering on Breast Cancer Dataset

This project applies **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **K-Means Clustering** from scratch using NumPy to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The goal is to explore unsupervised learning techniques for dimensionality reduction and clustering, and evaluate their performance and impact.

##  Objectives
- Implement PCA and K-Means without using Scikit-learn's built-in functions.
- Analyze the dataset using K-Means before and after applying PCA.
- Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Compare clustering results based on sum of squared errors and visualizations.

##  Experiments
1. **Experiment 1**: K-Means on original dataset.
2. **Experiment 2**: PCA applied first, followed by K-Means clustering.
   - Tried different numbers of principal components.
   - Visualized clustering output against true labels for analysis.
